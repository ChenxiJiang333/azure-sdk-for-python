# Generate docs CI check keeps failing

## question
I’m working on a Python SDK PR and the **generate-docs** CI check continues failing.
The error points to `CreateDeploymentDetails.azure_resource_ids` with:
> “Definition list ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.”
I’ve already updated the docstring based on this message, but CI still reports the same failure.
Here is the error log: [Pipelines - Run 20251209.42 logs](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/public/public%20Team/_build/results?buildId=5652585&view=logs&j=7b8caaf3-aec7-5f50-aa20-46d4a6342ac3&t=286a7ccb-1111-5827-fc90-5c974fed4202&l=313)

Could you please advise:
1. Is there a recommended way to run the generate-docs step locally so I can verify the fix without pusshing repeatedly?
2. Any guidance on the correct docstring formatting expected here?

## answer
There is an easy way to repro your failures: install `eng/tools/azure-sdk-tools[build]` . then just `azpysdk sphinx .` from your package directory.

# Pytest failure: test fixtures not being recognized

## question
I’m following the Python SDK testing guidance (link: [Dataplane Codegen Quick Start for Test · Azure/azure-sdk-for-python Wiki](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/wiki/Dataplane-Codegen-Quick-Start-for-Test)), but I’m seeing an issue related to fixtures not being recognized by pytest.
When running the tests, I get the following error: **fixture 'text_analysis_endpoint' not found**.

But I have the environment variables correctly configured in my `.env` , and I have a `conftest.py` file that follows the guidance exactly.
For reference, here is the `conftest.py` I’m using: [azure-sdk-for-python/sdk/cognitivelanguage/azure-ai-textanalytics/tests/conftest.py at dd52517afed9…](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/dd52517afed9dffae02a0239bb397be091643310/sdk/cognitivelanguage/azure-ai-textanalytics/tests/conftest.py)
```
import pytest

@pytest.fixture(scope="session", autouse=True)
def start_proxy(test_proxy, patch_sleep, patch_async_sleep):
    return
```

It seems like the fixtures are not being loaded into the test environment.
Did I miss something in the setup? Any pointers would be greatly appreciated — thank you!

## answer
The issue could resolved by directly defining the endpoint/key fixtures in conftest.py.
```
import pytest
from devtools_testutils import EnvironmentVariableLoader

# Environment variable keys
ENV_ENDPOINT = "TEXT_ANALYSIS_ENDPOINT"
ENV_KEY = "TEXT_ANALYSIS_KEY"

@pytest.fixture(scope="session")
def text_analysis_endpoint(environment_variables: EnvironmentVariableLoader) -> str:
    """Endpoint for Text Analysis tests."""
    return environment_variables.get(ENV_ENDPOINT)

@pytest.fixture(scope="session")
def text_analysis_key(environment_variables: EnvironmentVariableLoader) -> str:
    """API key for Text Analysis tests."""
    return environment_variables.get(ENV_KEY)

# autouse=True will trigger this fixture on each pytest run
# test_proxy auto-starts the test proxy
# patch_sleep and patch_async_sleep remove wait times during polling
@pytest.fixture(scope="session", autouse=True)
def start_proxy(test_proxy, patch_sleep, patch_async_sleep):
    return
```
