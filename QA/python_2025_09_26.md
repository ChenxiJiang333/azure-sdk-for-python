# ARM Manifest Rollout May Be Delayed — How to Request SDK Release Exception?

## question
Hi team,
Due to potential delays in the ARM manifest rollout before 10/7, we’re considering requesting an exception to release our SDKs on 10/14. I’d like to clarify the process.
Here are the SDK details:
- **Languages**: Java / Python / JavaScript / Go
- **Azure Product**: HDInsight
- **API Version**: `2025-01-15-preview`
A few questions:
**What’s the process for requesting an exception**?
- Who should we email?
**Should the email content only include what was filled in during the release plan creation?**
- Is there any additional information we need to provide?
If anyone has a **sample email** or **has gone through this process** before, I’d really appreciate your input!

## answer
The wiki guidance for SDK exception is [Request an exception for Azure SDKs](https://eng.ms/docs/products/azure-developer-experience/onboard/request-exception)

# Confirming Actual Release Date Based on Changelog?

## question
Hi team,
Quick question — in the PR for our package (`azure-mgmt-hdinsight`), the `CHANGELOG.md` lists the release date as **2025-10-19** for version `9.1.0b2`.
Just wanted to confirm: Is the actual release date determined by the date shown in the changelog?
**If not, how can I find out the actual release date?**
Thanks!

## answer
The date 2025-10-19 means SDK team plans to release it at that day so that we don't need to manually update it again when 10-19 coming. Date in changelog is almost the accurate date to release. Sometimes there may be unexpected delay, but in most time we will release it within 3 days after the date in changelog.
