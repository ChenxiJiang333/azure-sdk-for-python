## question 
Hi Language - Python,
We're updating the Python SDK for the service `communication/azure-communication-messages` to include new changes using the 'tsp-client update' using a commit #. However, we do not want to include the changes in the TypeSpec specification from a previous commit since we don't want to release those to Python yet.
Is there a way to only include the latest changes and not the previous one to Python?

Thanks

Is there a SHA on Github on the RestAPI repo that represents exactly the API you want, and only that? Tsp-Client is cloning the RestAPI repo, so it cannot filter files based on anything else that git can express.

Now, if you have APIs that are merged to main, but you don't want to ship them, you will need to define a custom cliennt.tsp file to explicitly list what you want to keep, and what you won't.

If it is some API you do not want to include, you may try the @scope decorator in client.tsp
