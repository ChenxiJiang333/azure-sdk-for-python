# Ubunty 2303 pypy39 specific failure

## question
Hi,

I am seeing this error in the pipeline. Can anyone check please?
```
         --- stderr
        error: the configured PyPy interpreter version (3.9) is lower than
      PyO3's minimum supported version (3.11)
      warning: build failed, waiting for other jobs to finish...
```

## answer
You have a dependency that doesn't ship a pypy39 dep. That's all. You could swap that with pypy311 in your matrix if you wanted to give it a shot.
