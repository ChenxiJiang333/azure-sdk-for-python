# "black" job in pipeline fails, but when I run locally, the tool does not make any changes

## question
I like to run the "black" tool before PRs, and I ask others in my project to do the same. A few hours ago I found out that I can turn on this check in the pipeline. I was happy to see this. So I added the following to pyproject.toml:

```
[tool.azure-sdk-build]
black = true
```

I run "black" before commiting my last change to the PR, and no updates were needed.

But the pipeline called out a "black" failure: https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/public/_build/results?buildId=5606772&view=logs&j=b70e5e73-bbb6-5567-0939-8415943fadb9&t=efe9ac6d-3fdb-50af-24e1-4319f36eecb4

I see the pipeline used black version 24.4.0. I had a newer version when I run locally. I install 24.4.0 and run that, but it also did not do any changes to the code.

Any idea how to fix it? (other than removing it from the pipeline...).

## answer
I tried the same command used by ci: `python -m azpysdk.main black --isolate /mnt/vss/_work/1/s/sdk/ai/azure-ai-projects`, and find that your project has one file reformatted.

NOTE: the command ci uses need some time and I recommend you use one simple command which usually has same effect and much faster: `black sdk/ai/azure-ai-projects/ -l 120`
