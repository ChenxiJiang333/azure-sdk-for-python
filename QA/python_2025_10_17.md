# Problem releasing remoterendering SDK for deprecation

## question
Hi,
I'm trying to release the remoterendering SDK with the deprecation notice according to Step 4 in [azure-sdk-for-python/doc/deprecation_process.md at main Â· Azure/azure-sdk-for-python](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/doc/deprecation_process.md).

I did all the merging and executed the `Prepare-Release.ps1step` described in the guide, but then I tried to follow [Run release SDK pipeline](https://eng.ms/docs/products/azure-developer-experience/develop/sdk-release/sdk-release-pipeline) to actually release the package and I ran into problems.

The output of the `python - remoterendering` pipeline [here](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/internal/_build/results?buildId=5452798&view=results) does not look at all like the output described on the guide page for the release. I don't see any `package-signed` artifacts or any review step I could do.

I see that the `Integration` step in the pipeline is skipping quiet a lot of things, but I don't know how to convince it to do more.

Any help?

The content of ci.yml contains this:
```
extends:
  template: ../../eng/pipelines/templates/stages/archetype-sdk-client.yml
  parameters:
    ServiceDirectory: remoterendering
    TestProxy: true
    Artifacts:
    - name: azure-mixedreality-remoterendering
      safeName: azuremixedrealityremoterendering
```

## answer
Your manually queued build here: [Pipelines - Run 20251015.1](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/internal/_build/results?buildId=5459981&view=results)

DOES reflect the stages you're expecting. The link you linked to above is the individual CI which runs automatically when a merge happens in that folder to `main`. They both have identical `SHA` ref, so you should be clear to release the deprecation now from your manually queued build.
