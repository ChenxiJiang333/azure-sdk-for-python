Hello Language - Python
I have this PR [Improve typing by sofiar-msft · Pull Request #42596 · Azure/azure-sdk-for-python](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/pull/42596) and I'm seeing these errors:
```
2025-09-02T17:36:41.9509070Z ##[error]Invalid date [ 2025-08-28 ]. The date for the changelog being released must be the latest in the file.
2025-09-02T17:36:41.9509929Z ##[debug]Processed: ##vso[task.LogIssue type=error;]Invalid date [ 2025-08-28 ]. The date for the changelog being released must be the latest in the file.
2025-09-02T17:36:41.9588754Z ##[error]The changelog entry has the following sections with no content (Other Changes). Please ensure to either remove the empty sections or add content to the section.
```
But our current changelog version has unreleased and I also do not see any empty section either so I'm not sure why is this failling.

## answer
try updating the VERSIONconstant in azure/communication/phonenumbers/_version.py to also be 1.5.0. That might be throwing things off.

# CI Checks Failing – Request for Guidance

## question 
Hi team,

I have two PRs with failing CI checks that I haven’t been able to resolve, and I’d appreciate your help in understanding the issues.
PR 1: [[Conv authoring] python sdk 20250515preview by amber-Chen-86 · Pull Request #42149 · Azure/azure-sd…](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/pull/42149)

I’m not sure how to approach fixing this one.
PR 2: [[Textanalytics] Textanalytics sdk 20250515prevew by amber-Chen-86 · Pull Request #42685 · Azure/azu…](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/pull/42685)
Failing check: Update Snippets
Error message: reports duplicate snippet names, e.g. text_extractive_summarization ([link: https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/public/_build/results?buildId=5293744&view=logs&j=b70e5e73-bbb6-5567-0939-8415943fadb9&t=b42a4c77-4205-522f-5a57-db739203b1a5&l=178]).
```
Found duplicated snippet name "sample_extract_summary.text_extractive_summarization".
```
However, I can only find one text_extractive_summarization snippet (with one start and one end) in this project. The same situation occurs with other supposed duplicates.
Could you please provide guidance on how to resolve these? Thank you!

This `azure-ai-language-conversationis` a hard dependency I was recommended to add for this authoring package. It is only for this package. But the error says it is not present in `shared_requirements.txt`.

## answer
I think we just need to add to shared_requirements.txt:
[azure-sdk-for-python/shared_requirements.txt at main · Azure/azure-sdk-for-python](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/shared_requirements.txt)

`azure-appconfiguration` and `azure-eventhub` are others example of this kind of extension package dependency.
It's definitely common across all packages. dependencies need to be approved before being added here and discussed with architects.
