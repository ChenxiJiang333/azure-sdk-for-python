# When emitting Python from TypeSpec, how do I rename an operation path parameter?

## question
I have this operation defined in TypeSpec. I know I can add the `@clientName` to change the name of the input parameter in the emitted Python operation method. This TypeSpec compiles fine (see [full TypeSpec file here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs-pr/blob/feature/ai-foundry/agents-v2/specification/ai/Azure.AI.Projects/agents/operations.tsp#L56)):

```
interface Agents {

  @post
  @route("/agents/{agent_name}")
  @tag("Agents")
  updateAgent is AgentOperation<
    {
      @path
      @clientName("name", "python")
      agent_name: string;

      ...UpdateAgentRequest;
    },
    AgentObject
  >;

}
```

However I'm trying to avoid adding @clientName decorators in TypeSpec model definitions, and instead have them all in the client.tsp file.

My question: how do I do the above, but using @@clientName in client.tsp file instead? I've tried many things, but no luck. Including:

```
@@clientName(Agents.updateAgent::parameters.agent_name, "name", "python");
```

which files to compile with error `Model doesn't have member agent_name`. In the above case it's not a member but a path, so perhaps that's the reason for the error, but I don't know how to fix it.

## answer
You could define an alias to include path parameters then rename the path parameters by the alias like :
```

alias UpdateAgentParams = {
    @path originalName1: string;
};

interface MyOp {
  @post
  @route("/name/{originalName1}")
  updateAgent1 is AgentOperation<
    UpdateAgentParams,
    void
  >;

  @post
  @route("/name/{originalName2}")
  updateAgent2 is AgentOperation<
    {
      @path originalName2: string;
    },
    void
  >;
}

@@clientName(UpdateAgentParams.originalName1, "newName1"); // OK

// Can't work since Typespec can't refer to parameter defined in an anonymous model in Template
// @clientName(MyOp.updateAgent2::parameters.originalName2, "newName2");
```
