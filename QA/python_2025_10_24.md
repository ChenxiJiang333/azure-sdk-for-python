## answer
Two options.

1. Regenerate your package using the `emitter-package.json` that's in `main`. Submit that PR.
Submit a targeted PR that changes the `pyproject.toml` for your package to exclude the directories that shouldn't be there. Here is a PR generated from the newer emitter package. https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/pull/43272/files#r2430170753
2. You could manually update your `pyproject.toml` to align with what you see in this PR. That's also an option.
