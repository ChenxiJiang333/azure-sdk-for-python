# Python Live Test for async api

## question 
Hello Language - Python,

We at Callautomation are working on adding live tests for the async APIs. When I tried to run a live test, I encountered an SSL certificate issue, as shown below. Could you help me understand what I might be missing?

```
        except aiohttp.client_exceptions.ClientError as err:
>           raise ServiceRequestError(err, error=err) from err
E           azure.core.exceptions.ServiceRequestError: Cannot connect to host localhost:5001 ssl:True [SSLCertVerificationError: (1, '[SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: self-signed certificate (_ssl.c:1028)')]

C:\Users\v-dharmarajv\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\Lib\site-packages\azure\core\pipeline\transport\_aiohttp.py:364: ServiceRequestError
```

## answer
You're encountering an SSL certificate error when running live tests for async APIs, specifically when connecting to https://localhost:5001. This is the test proxy endpoint, and the error is likely due to certificate verification failing. Although the same code works for another team member, the issue may be caused by environment variables â€” either missing or incorrectly set.

To run live tests, make sure AZURE_TEST_RUN_LIVE is set to "true". If you also want to record, avoid setting AZURE_SKIP_LIVE_RECORDING. As a workaround for the SSL issue, set the environment variable PROXY_URL to http://localhost:5000 instead of using HTTPS. This bypasses certificate validation and resolves the issue.

# release pipeline link for Python SDK `azure-mgmt-resource-bicep`

## question

How to find the specific release pipeline link of Python SDK `azure-mgmt-resource-bicep` and it would be nicer if someone can provide me the link directly.

## answer

To find the specific release pipeline link for the Python SDK `azure-mgmt-resource-bicep`, you typically need to locate the corresponding pipeline in Azure DevOps under the internal Azure SDK project. The naming convention for the pipeline is usually `python - <servicedir>`, where `<servicedir>` matches the service directory (in this case, likely resource or resource-bicep).

Here is the general process:
1. Go to [Azure DevOps - Azure SDK Internal Project](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/internal/_build)
2. Search for the pipeline named `python - resource` or similar, as the pipeline is named according to the service directory for management SDKs.
3. The direct link format for a service pipeline is: `https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/internal/_build?definitionId=<ID>&_a=summary`
- You can search for `resource` in the pipelines list to locate the exact one.
