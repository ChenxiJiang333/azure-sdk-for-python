## 1.0.0b1 (2020-12-09)

This is beta preview version.

This version uses a next-generation code generator that introduces important breaking changes, but also important new features (like unified authentication and async programming).

**General breaking changes**

- Credential system has been completly revamped:

  - `azure.common.credentials` or `msrestazure.azure_active_directory` instances are no longer supported, use the `azure-identity` classes instead: https://pypi.org/project/azure-identity/
  - `credentials` parameter has been renamed `credential`

- The `config` attribute no longer exists on a client, configuration should be passed as kwarg. Example: `MyClient(credential, subscription_id, enable_logging=True)`. For a complete set of
  supported options, see the [parameters accept in init documentation of azure-core](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/core/azure-core/CLIENT_LIBRARY_DEVELOPER.md#available-policies)
- You can't import a `version` module anymore, use `__version__` instead
- Operations that used to return a `msrest.polling.LROPoller` now returns a `azure.core.polling.LROPoller` and are prefixed with `begin_`.
- Exceptions tree have been simplified and most exceptions are now `azure.core.exceptions.HttpResponseError` (`CloudError` has been removed).
- Most of the operation kwarg have changed. Some of the most noticeable:

  - `raw` has been removed. Equivalent feature can be found using `cls`, a callback that will give access to internal HTTP response for advanced user
  - For a complete set of
  supported options, see the [parameters accept in Request documentation of azure-core](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/core/azure-core/CLIENT_LIBRARY_DEVELOPER.md#available-policies)


## 0.2.0 (2020-04-08)

**Features**

  - Added operation DimensionsOperations.list
  - Added operation QueryOperations.usage

**Breaking changes**

  - Model QueryDataset no longer has parameter sorting
  - Removed operation DimensionsOperations.list_by_subscription
  - Removed operation QueryOperations.usage_by_scope

**General Breaking Changes**

This version uses a next-generation code generator that *might*
introduce breaking changes. In summary, some modules were incorrectly
visible/importable and have been renamed. This fixed several issues
caused by usage of classes that were not supposed to be used in the
first place.

  - CostManagementClient cannot be imported from
    `azure.mgmt.costmanagement.cost_management_client` anymore (import from
    `azure.mgmt.costmanagement` works like before)
  - CostManagementClientConfiguration import has been moved from
    `azure.mgmt.costmanagement.cost_management_client` to `azure.mgmt.costmanagement`
  - A model `MyClass` from a "models" sub-module cannot be imported
    anymore using `azure.mgmt.costmanagement.models.my_class` (import from
    `azure.mgmt.costmanagement.models` works like before)
  - An operation class `MyClassOperations` from an `operations`
    sub-module cannot be imported anymore using
    `azure.mgmt.costmanagement.operations.my_class_operations` (import from
    `azure.mgmt.costmanagement.operations` works like before)
